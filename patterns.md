## 1. Sliding Window
### Overview
Sliding Window problems will ask you to perform an operation on a "window" of an array, list or string. A window is a subset of elements of a data structure, which begins at the first index and progressively slides to the next indecies, and can grow or shrink in size.

### Common Signs
* Input is a linear data structure (array, list, or string)
* Asked to identify longest/shortest substring, subarray, or a desired value

### Example Problems
* [Maximum sum subarray of size K](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/) (easy)
* [Longest substring with K distinct characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-with-at-least-k-repeating-characters/) (medium)
* [String anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/) (hard)

## 2. Two Pointers
### Overview
Two Pointers problems will use two pointers to iterate through data structures until a condition is met. Oftentimes this can come in the form of searching pairs in a sorted array or list.

### Common Signs
* Provided data is a sorted array or list, and asked to find a set of elements that fit certain constraints
* Set of elements to be identified is a pair, triplet, or subarray

### Example Problems
* [Squaring a sorted array](https://leetcode.com/problems/squares-of-a-sorted-array/) (easy)
* [Triplets that sum to zero](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/) (medium)
* [Comparing strings that contain backspaces](https://leetcode.com/problems/backspace-string-compare/) (medium)
