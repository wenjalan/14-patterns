## 1. Sliding Window
### Overview
Sliding Window problems will ask you to perform an operation on a "window" of an array, list or string. A window is a subset of elements of a data structure, which begins at the first index and progressively slides to the next indecies, and can grow or shrink in size.

### Common Signs
* Input is a linear data structure (array, list, or string)
* Asked to identify longest/shortest substring, subarray, or a desired value

### Common Problems
* Maximum sum subarray of size K (easy)
* Longest substring with K distinct characters (medium)
* String anagrams (hard)
